[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

**Exercise 2.4** Using the variable *totalwgt_lb*, investigate whether first ba-
bies are lighter or heavier than others.  Compute Cohen's d to quantify the
difference between the groups. How does it compare to the difference in
pregnancy length?

>> Cohen's d here is -0.088
>> This is a small effect.
>> This is a greater effect than that of pregnancy length.  But it is still "small".
