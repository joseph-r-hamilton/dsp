[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

**Exercise 4.2** The numbers generated by *random.random* are supposed to be
uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the
same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from *random.random* and plot their PMF and CDF.
Is the distribution uniform?


>> The distribution certainly looks uniform.  All thousand of the randomly generated numbers were unique.  So the PMF approximates the typical square of a uniform PDF.  The CDF is pretty close to y=x.
